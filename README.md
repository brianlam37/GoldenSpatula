Just a web mock up of a product site that I made on freecodecamp originally.

## Background

As I was learning web design in plain html/css on freecodecamp I made a pretty poorly designed website and just wanted to try to improve it.

The original can be found [https://codepen.io/blam37/pen/oNwNGbY](here)

Unfortunately I've discovered I don't know what kind of content is good for a joke product site but I hope the UI looks better.
